#  **About Dataset**


It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The dataset in question comprises credit card transactions executed by European cardholders in September 2013. It encapsulates **284,807** transactions that transpired within a span of two days, of which only **492** were fraudulent. This dataset presents a substantial imbalance, as fraudulent transactions represent a mere **0.17%** of all the transactions.

The dataset incorporates numerical input variables that have been derived from a PCA transformation. The attributes V1, V2, ..., V28 are the primary components achieved through PCA, whereas 'Time' and 'Amount' remain as the untransformed original features. 'Time' denotes the seconds that have passed between each transaction and the inaugural transaction in the dataset, while 'Amount' corresponds to the value of the transaction. The 'Class' attribute serves as the response variable, assuming the value 1 in instances of fraud and 0 otherwise.
